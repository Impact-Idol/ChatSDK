# Archive Directory

This directory contains development artifacts that are not needed for production but kept for reference.

## Contents:

### development-notes/
Internal notes, status tracking, and planning documents from development phase.
These were useful during development but are not needed for deployment.

### reference-code/
Reference implementations from other chat platforms:
- Huly (1.5GB) - Enterprise platform reference
- Raven - Team messaging reference  
- Zulip - Topic-based chat reference
- OpenIM SDK research

These were studied for inspiration but are not part of ChatSDK.

### old-builds/
Old tar.gz packages and build artifacts.

## Why Archive?

- **Keep root clean** - Only essential files in root
- **Preserve history** - Don't delete, archive for future reference
- **Reduce clutter** - Easier to navigate active codebase
- **Git ignore** - Archive is gitignored to keep repo lean

## When to Access:

- Need to reference original implementations
- Review development decisions
- Check old planning docs
